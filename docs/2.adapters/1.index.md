# Adapters

crossws allows integrating your WebSocket hooks with different runtimes and platforms using built-in adapters. Each runtime has a specific method of integrating WebSocket. Once integrated, will work consistently even if you change the runtime.

See Adapters section to learn more about all available built-in adapters.
